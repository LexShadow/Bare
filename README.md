# Bare
A single file directory-to-blog

Bare has no usernames, passwords, editors, file uploaders, or other  
mechanisms that get in the way of writing your thoughts. Simply put your  
posts in year/month/day/slug.md format, and Bare will publish it. You  
also schedule posts to be published at a future date as bare will only  
show posts from the current date and into the past.

Bare will also create an archive of all posts and create a syndication  
feed of the most recent ones.

Bare understands a rudimentary subset of [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and will filter HTML  
for you. 


Formatting and installation follow the same conventions as the 
[Pad](https://github.com/cypnk/Pad) project.

Bare supports caching of formatted posts. Simply enable write  
permissions to the cache directory following the instructions in the Pad  
project.
